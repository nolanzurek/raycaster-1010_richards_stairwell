TODO

- Check if rays have left the bounding box and stop simulating them if this has happened
- Distance from line checking can probably be more efficient
- remove signed distance function 69s
- have less expensive light source
- bounding set of diagonal parallel lines instead of box
- have ray line intersection in external module
